### About This Event

Join us for a deep dive into **Agentic AI** and **Application-to-Application (A2A)** integration, exploring how these technologies are redefining enterprise automation and multi-agent collaboration. This two-session event combines technical insights, real-world use cases, and hands-on demos to empower developers and AI practitioners.

### Agenda

* **2:30 PM - 3:00 PM** - Welcome & Registration
* **3:00 PM - 4:15 PM** - Session 1: Agentic AI â€“ Autonomous Systems in Action
* **4:15 PM - 4:30 PM** - Coffee Break
* **4:30 PM - 5:15 PM** - Session 2: MCP & A2A â€“ The Backbone of Connected AI
* **5:15 PM - 6:00 PM** - Hands-On Labs & Live Demos

### ðŸ¤– Session 1: Agentic AI â€“ Autonomous Systems in Action

Discover how Agentic AI enables systems to reason, plan, and act independently. Learn about:

* **Architecture:** How agents leverage LLMs, dynamic reasoning, and orchestration
* **Multi-agent collaboration:** Case studies of agents working together to solve complex tasks
* **Enterprise applications:** From supply chain optimization to real-time decision-making

### ðŸ”— Session 2: MCP & A2A â€“ The Backbone of Connected AI

Dive into the protocols powering seamless integration:

**Model Context Protocol (MCP):**
* A universal interface for AI agents to access tools, APIs, and data dynamically
* Enables plug-and-play connectivity, eliminating custom integration work

**A2A Integration:**
* **Traditional A2A:** SAP's approach to automating data exchange between internal systems (CRM, ERP) using middleware like Integration Builder
* **Modern A2A:** Google's open-source **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol**, enabling cross-framework agent communication via tasks, messages, and streaming

### ðŸŽ¯ Why Attend?

* **Live Demos:** See A2A in action
* **Enterprise Use Cases:** Learn how companies automate inventory management, procurement, and customer interactions using A2A
* **Hands-On Labs:** Experiment with A2A protocol implementations (Python/JS) and MCP-based agent servers
* **GCP Credits:** Workshop participants will receive Google Cloud Platform credits
