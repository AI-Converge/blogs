### About This Event

Join us for a dynamic meetup exploring the cutting edge of AI agentic workflows! This collaborative event with **Weights & Biases** will dive into both the design principles and practical implementation of autonomous AI systems, along with crucial strategies for ensuring their traceability and reliability in production.

**Are you building intelligent agents? Or are you curious about how autonomous AI systems are designed and put into production?**

This meetup brings together experts from the community and Weights & Biases to demystify agentic workflows. We'll cover two crucial aspects of building and monitoring intelligent AI systems.

### Agenda

* **10:00 AM - 10:30 AM** - Welcome & Registration
* **10:30 AM - 11:45 AM** - Session 1: Designing & Building Agentic Workflows
* **11:45 AM - 12:00 PM** - Coffee Break
* **12:00 PM - 12:45 PM** - Session 2: Traceability and Observability with W&B
* **12:45 PM - 1:00 PM** - Hands-On Session & Q&A

### ðŸ¤– Session 1: Designing & Building Agentic Workflows

* **The Blueprint for Autonomy:** Explore fundamental design patterns for agentic workflows, moving beyond simple LLM calls to create truly intelligent and adaptable systems
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP):** Learn how MCP empowers individual agents to interact with external tools and data sources, providing necessary context for effective decision-making
* **Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Communication:** Discover how A2A enables multiple, specialized agents to collaborate seamlessly, delegate tasks, and share information
* **Practical Implementation:** Share practical examples and strategies for building these workflows, from initial concept to deployable architecture

### ðŸ“Š Session 2: Traceability and Observability with Weights & Biases

* **The Black Box Problem:** Gain full visibility into your agent's decision-making process, tool usage, and interactions using W&B tools
* **Debugging and Iteration:** Learn how W&B tools like Weave provide detailed traces of agent rollouts for quick issue identification and performance evaluation
* **Monitoring in Production:** Understand continuous monitoring importance for ensuring reliability, safety, and performance in real-world applications
* **Evaluation Metrics & Guardrails:** Establish robust evaluation pipelines and implement guardrails to mitigate risks like hallucinations and prompt attacks

### ðŸŽ¯ Special Announcement

**Mistral Agents API:** Following Mistral's recent launch of their Agents API, expect to have someone from Mistral talking about the Agents API and how to build with it!
