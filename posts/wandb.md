---

As LLM agents become increasingly sophisticated and integral to production systems, the need for robust observability and monitoring has never been more critical. Weights & Biases (W&B) has emerged as a leading platform for LLM agent tracing through their specialized toolkit, **W&B Weave**, which provides comprehensive monitoring, debugging, and evaluation capabilities specifically designed for generative AI applications. This guide explores everything you need to know about implementing effective LLM agent tracing with W&B.

## Introduction to LLM agent tracing and why it matters

LLM agent tracing refers to the systematic monitoring and recording of every interaction, decision, and operation performed by AI agents during their execution. Unlike traditional software systems, LLM agents present unique observability challenges: they operate with probabilistic outputs, engage in complex multi-step reasoning, interact with various tools and APIs, and often work collaboratively in multi-agent systems.

The importance of comprehensive agent tracing cannot be overstated. **Without proper observability, LLM applications operate as black boxes**, making it nearly impossible to debug failures, optimize performance, ensure safety and compliance, or understand cost implications. Effective tracing enables developers to identify where agents struggle or hallucinate, monitor real-world usage patterns, track token consumption and associated costs, and ensure consistent quality across deployments.

## W&B's capabilities for LLM agent monitoring

In December 2024, Weights & Biases announced the general availability of **W&B Weave**, marking a significant evolution from their traditional ML tracking tools to a purpose-built LLM observability platform. This transition represents a fundamental shift in approach, focusing on the experimental and iterative nature of generative AI development.

### Core capabilities of W&B Weave

The platform offers **one-line setup** with automatic tracing through a simple `weave.init('project-name')` call. This automatically patches popular LLM providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral, and Google AI, capturing inputs, outputs, code, metadata, and execution context at every level.

**Trace tree visualization** organizes logs hierarchically, enabling developers to quickly navigate complex agent workflows and identify issues. The platform provides specialized views for different data types, including a chat view for conversational threads and multi-modal support for text, code, documents, images, and audio.

### How Weave differs from traditional W&B tracking

Unlike the run-based structure of traditional ML experiments, Weave uses a **call-based system** more suitable for LLM applications. It includes built-in evaluation frameworks with scoring and comparison tools specifically for LLM outputs, direct integration with prompt experimentation playgrounds, and comprehensive guardrails support for content moderation and safety.

The lightweight architecture minimizes cognitive overhead compared to traditional ML tracking, while string-focused visualizations optimize the viewing of large text outputs, documents, and code snippets that are common in LLM applications.

## Technical implementation with code examples

### Basic setup and initialization

Getting started with W&B Weave requires minimal configuration:

```python
import weave
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize Weave with your project name
weave.init("my-agent-project")

# Set up your LLM client
client = OpenAI()
```

For automated environments, you can set authentication via environment variables:

```python
import os
os.environ["WANDB_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"
```

### Implementing basic agent tracing

The fundamental building block for tracing is the `@weave.op()` decorator, which automatically captures function execution details:

```python
@weave.op()
def simple_agent(query: str) -> str:
    """Basic agent that responds to queries"""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ],
        temperature=0.7
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

# Usage - automatically traced
result = simple_agent("What is quantum computing?")
```

### Advanced multi-agent implementation

For complex multi-agent systems, Weave provides comprehensive tracing across agent interactions:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Dict

class AnalysisResult(BaseModel):
    insights: List[str]
    confidence: float
    recommendations: List[str]

@weave.op()
def data_processing_agent(raw_data: str) -> Dict:
    """Agent responsible for data cleaning and transformation"""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system", 
                "content": "You are a data processing agent. Clean and transform the provided data."
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Process this data: {raw_data}"}
        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )
    return {"processed_data": response.choices[0].message.content}

@weave.op()
def analysis_agent(processed_data: Dict) -> AnalysisResult:
    """Agent responsible for data analysis and insights"""
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an analysis agent. Analyze the processed data and provide insights."
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze: {processed_data}"}
        ]
    )
    
    return AnalysisResult(
        insights=["Key trend identified", "Anomaly detected"],
        confidence=0.87,
        recommendations=["Action A", "Action B"]
    )

@weave.op()
def orchestrator_agent(user_query: str) -> Dict:
    """Main orchestrator that coordinates multiple agents"""
    # Step 1: Process data
    processing_result = data_processing_agent(user_query)
    
    # Step 2: Analyze processed data
    analysis_result = analysis_agent(processing_result)
    
    return {
        "processing_result": processing_result,
        "analysis_result": analysis_result.model_dump()
    }

# Execute multi-agent workflow - fully traced
result = orchestrator_agent("Analyze sales data from Q4 2024")
```

## Best practices for different agent types

### Conversational agents

For conversational agents, **maintaining context across interactions** is crucial. Implement session-based tracing to preserve conversation history:

```python
class ConversationHistory:
    def __init__(self):
        self.messages: List[Dict] = []
    
    def add_message(self, role: str, content: str):
        self.messages.append({"role": role, "content": content})
    
    def get_context(self) -> List[Dict]:
        return self.messages[-10:]  # Keep last 10 messages

@weave.op()
def conversational_agent(user_input: str, conversation_id: str = "default") -> str:
    """Agent that maintains conversation context"""
    if not hasattr(conversational_agent, '_conversations'):
        conversational_agent._conversations = {}
    
    if conversation_id not in conversational_agent._conversations:
        conversational_agent._conversations[conversation_id] = ConversationHistory()
    
    history = conversational_agent._conversations[conversation_id]
    history.add_message("user", user_input)
    
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that maintains context."},
    ] + history.get_context()
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=messages
    )
    
    assistant_response = response.choices[0].message.content
    history.add_message("assistant", assistant_response)
    
    return assistant_response
```

Best practices include using W&B Weave's chat view for thread visualization, implementing user feedback collection through the platform's built-in mechanisms, and monitoring conversation quality metrics like coherence, relevance, and safety.

### Tool-using agents

Tool-using agents require **detailed tracing of tool interactions**. Implement comprehensive tool monitoring:

```python
TOOLS = {
    "web_search": web_search_tool,
    "calculator": calculator_tool,
    "file_manager": file_manager_tool
}

@weave.op()
def tool_using_agent(user_request: str) -> str:
    """Agent that can use various tools to complete tasks"""
    
    # Step 1: Determine which tools to use
    planning_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": f"""You are a helpful assistant with access to tools: {list(TOOLS.keys())}.
                Analyze the user request and determine which tools you need to use.
                Respond with a JSON list of tool calls."""
            },
            {"role": "user", "content": user_request}
        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )
    
    tool_plan = json.loads(planning_response.choices[0].message.content)
    tool_calls = tool_plan.get("tool_calls", [])
    
    # Step 2: Execute tools with tracing
    tool_results = []
    for tool_call in tool_calls:
        tool_name = tool_call.get("tool")
        tool_args = tool_call.get("args", {})
        
        if tool_name in TOOLS:
            result = TOOLS[tool_name](**tool_args)
            tool_results.append({
                "tool": tool_name,
                "args": tool_args,
                "result": result
            })
    
    # Step 3: Generate final response
    final_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "Use the tool results to provide a comprehensive answer."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": f"Request: {user_request}\nTool Results: {json.dumps(tool_results, indent=2)}"
            }
        ]
    )
    
    return final_response.choices[0].message.content
```

Key metrics to monitor include tool call frequency and patterns, execution success rates, decision-making accuracy for tool selection, and latency per tool interaction.

### Multi-step reasoning agents

For agents performing complex planning and reasoning, **hierarchical tracing** captures the complete decision-making process:

```python
@weave.op()
def planning_agent(goal: str) -> Dict:
    """Agent that creates and executes multi-step plans"""
    
    # Generate initial plan
    plan = generate_plan(goal)
    
    # Execute plan steps with monitoring
    results = []
    for step in plan:
        step_result = execute_step(step)
        results.append(step_result)
        
        # Check if re-planning is needed
        if requires_adaptation(step_result):
            plan = replan(goal, results)
    
    return {
        "goal": goal,
        "initial_plan": plan,
        "execution_results": results,
        "adaptations": get_adaptation_count()
    }
```

Best practices include logging intermediate reasoning steps, tracking plan execution versus initial strategy, and monitoring adaptation and re-planning events.

## Advanced features: Weave for LLM tracing

### OpenTelemetry integration

W&B Weave provides **native OpenTelemetry (OTEL) support**, enabling cross-language tracing:

```python
# Configure OTEL exporter for Weave
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor

# Set up OTEL with Weave endpoint
otlp_exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint="https://api.wandb.ai/otel/v1/traces",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {WANDB_API_KEY}"}
)

provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(otlp_exporter)
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
```

This enables tracing from any programming language that supports OTEL, proper parsing of GenAI span attributes according to OTEL standards, and integration with existing observability infrastructure.

### Online evaluations

Weave's **online evaluation** feature enables real-time scoring of production traces without performance impact:

```python
@weave.op()
def response_quality_scorer(response: str, expected_topics: List[str]) -> Dict:
    """Custom scorer for evaluating agent responses"""
    
    evaluation_prompt = f"""
    Evaluate this response based on the expected topics: {expected_topics}
    Response: {response}
    
    Rate on a scale of 1-10 for:
    1. Relevance to topics
    2. Completeness
    3. Accuracy
    4. Helpfulness
    
    Return as JSON with scores and reasoning.
    """
    
    eval_response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": evaluation_prompt}],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"}
    )
    
    return json.loads(eval_response.choices[0].message.content)

@weave.op()
def monitored_agent(query: str) -> Dict:
    """Agent with built-in monitoring and evaluation"""
    
    # Generate response
    response = simple_agent(query)
    
    # Evaluate response quality
    expected_topics = ["helpful", "accurate", "relevant"]
    quality_score = response_quality_scorer(response, expected_topics)
    
    return {
        "query": query,
        "response": response,
        "quality_evaluation": quality_score,
        "timestamp": time.time()
    }
```

### Guardrails and safety

Implement **comprehensive safety measures** using Weave's built-in capabilities:

```python
def redact_sensitive_data(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    """Remove sensitive information from traced inputs"""
    sanitized = inputs.copy()
    sensitive_fields = ["email", "password", "ssn", "credit_card"]
    
    for field in sensitive_fields:
        if field in sanitized:
            sanitized[field] = "[REDACTED]"
    
    return sanitized

@weave.op(
    postprocess_inputs=redact_sensitive_data,
    postprocess_output=lambda x: weave.Markdown(f"**Agent Response:**\n\n{x}")
)
def privacy_aware_agent(user_input: str, email: str = None) -> str:
    """Agent with privacy protection"""
    # Agent logic here
    return f"Processed request for user"
```

## Performance monitoring and debugging techniques

### Identifying performance bottlenecks

W&B Weave automatically aggregates **latency and cost metrics** at every level of the trace tree:

```python
@weave.op()
def performance_monitored_agent(query: str) -> Dict:
    """Agent with detailed performance monitoring"""
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Track individual component timings
    preprocessing_start = time.time()
    processed_query = preprocess_query(query)
    preprocessing_time = time.time() - preprocessing_start
    
    llm_start = time.time()
    response = generate_response(processed_query)
    llm_time = time.time() - llm_start
    
    postprocessing_start = time.time()
    final_response = postprocess_response(response)
    postprocessing_time = time.time() - postprocessing_start
    
    total_time = time.time() - start_time
    
    return {
        "response": final_response,
        "performance_metrics": {
            "total_latency": total_time,
            "preprocessing_latency": preprocessing_time,
            "llm_latency": llm_time,
            "postprocessing_latency": postprocessing_time
        }
    }
```

### Debugging complex agent workflows

The platform's **interactive trace tree navigation** enables deep debugging:

1. **Hierarchical visualization** shows complete execution flow across all agents
2. **Click-through interfaces** allow examination of large strings, documents, and code
3. **Format switching** provides optimal readability for different content types
4. **Error context** captures full execution state when failures occur

### Cost optimization strategies

Monitor and optimize token usage across your agent systems:

```python
@weave.op()
def cost_optimized_agent(query: str, complexity: str = "simple") -> str:
    """Agent that selects models based on task complexity"""
    
    # Model selection based on complexity
    model_map = {
        "simple": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "medium": "gpt-4",
        "complex": "gpt-4-turbo"
    }
    
    selected_model = model_map.get(complexity, "gpt-3.5-turbo")
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model=selected_model,
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a cost-conscious assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": query}
        ],
        max_tokens=calculate_token_limit(complexity)
    )
    
    # Log cost metrics
    log_token_usage(response.usage)
    
    return response.choices[0].message.content
```

## Integration patterns with popular frameworks

### LangChain integration

W&B Weave provides **seamless LangChain integration** with automatic tracing:

```python
import weave
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools

# Initialize Weave - automatically enables LangChain tracing
weave.init("langchain-agent-demo")

# Create LangChain agent
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["llm-math", "serpapi"], llm=llm)

agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, 
    llm, 
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, 
    verbose=True
)

# All interactions automatically traced
result = agent.run("What is the population of Tokyo multiplied by 2?")
```

For more control, use manual integration:

```python
from weave.integrations.langchain import WeaveTracer, weave_tracing_enabled

# Option 1: Use WeaveTracer callback
weave_tracer = WeaveTracer()
config = {"callbacks": [weave_tracer]}

llm_chain = prompt | llm
output = llm_chain.invoke({"query": "test"}, config=config)

# Option 2: Use context manager for selective tracing
with weave_tracing_enabled():
    output = llm_chain.invoke({"query": "traced call"})
```

### CrewAI integration

**CrewAI multi-agent systems** are automatically traced:

```python
import weave
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM

weave.init("crewai-agent-demo")

# Create LLM
llm = LLM(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# Create agents
researcher = Agent(
    role='Research Analyst',
    goal='Find and analyze investment opportunities',
    backstory='Expert in financial analysis',
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)

writer = Agent(
    role='Report Writer',
    goal='Write clear investment reports',
    backstory='Experienced financial writer',
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True
)

# Create tasks and crew
research_task = Task(
    description='Research the {topic} market',
    expected_output='Comprehensive analysis',
    agent=researcher
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher, writer],
    tasks=[research_task],
    verbose=True
)

# Execute - automatically traced
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={'topic': 'renewable energy'})
```

### LlamaIndex integration

**LlamaIndex RAG pipelines** benefit from automatic tracing:

```python
import weave
from llama_index import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader

weave.init("llamaindex-rag-demo")

# Load documents and create index
documents = SimpleDirectoryReader('data').load_data()
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)

# Query with automatic tracing
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
response = query_engine.query("What are the key findings?")
```

### Custom framework integration

For custom frameworks, use the **flexible @weave.op() decorator**:

```python
class CustomAgent:
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
    
    @weave.op()
    def process(self, input_data: str) -> str:
        """Custom processing logic with automatic tracing"""
        # Your agent logic here
        return f"{self.name} processed: {input_data}"
    
    @weave.op()
    def collaborate(self, other_agent: 'CustomAgent', task: str) -> str:
        """Multi-agent collaboration with tracing"""
        my_result = self.process(task)
        other_result = other_agent.process(task)
        
        return f"Collaboration result: {my_result} + {other_result}"
```

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Configuration challenges

**Issue: Initialization timing problems**
```python
# Incorrect - wandb.login() after weave.init()
weave.init("project")
wandb.login()  # This may cause issues

# Correct - authenticate before initialization
wandb.login()
weave.init("project")
```

**Issue: Environment variable conflicts**
```python
# Set environment variables before any imports
import os
os.environ["LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"] = "my-project"

# Then import libraries
import weave
from langchain import ...
```

### Performance issues

**Issue: Large trace data volumes**
```python
# Implement data truncation for large outputs
def truncate_large_data(data: str, max_length: int = 10000) -> str:
    if len(data) > max_length:
        return data[:max_length] + "... [TRUNCATED]"
    return data

@weave.op(postprocess_output=truncate_large_data)
def data_intensive_agent(large_input: str) -> str:
    # Process large data
    return processed_result
```

**Issue: Memory management**
```python
# Use streaming for large responses
@weave.op()
def streaming_agent(query: str):
    """Agent with streaming response handling"""
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": query}],
        stream=True
    )
    
    full_response = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            full_response += chunk.choices[0].delta.content
    
    return full_response
```

### Integration-specific issues

**Issue: Async callback ordering in LangChain**
```python
# Workaround for async trace ordering
import asyncio

async def ordered_async_execution(tasks):
    """Ensure proper trace ordering for async operations"""
    results = []
    for task in tasks:
        result = await task
        results.append(result)
    return results
```

**Issue: Framework version compatibility**
```python
# Check version compatibility
import weave
import langchain

print(f"Weave version: {weave.__version__}")
print(f"LangChain version: {langchain.__version__}")

# Use compatible versions as documented
```

### Security and privacy concerns

**Issue: Accidental logging of sensitive data**
```python
# Global postprocessing for all operations
def global_pii_redactor(data):
    """Redact PII from all traced data"""
    if isinstance(data, str):
        # Redact email addresses
        data = re.sub(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b', '[EMAIL]', data)
        # Redact phone numbers
        data = re.sub(r'\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b', '[PHONE]', data)
    return data

weave.init(
    "secure-project",
    global_postprocess_output=global_pii_redactor
)
```

**Issue: Conditional tracing based on environment**
```python
# Disable tracing in production if needed
import os

if os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT") == "production":
    os.environ["WEAVE_DISABLED"] = "true"

# Or use conditional initialization
if os.getenv("ENABLE_TRACING", "false").lower() == "true":
    weave.init("conditional-project")
```

## Future considerations and emerging patterns

### The evolution of LLM observability

The landscape of LLM observability is rapidly evolving, with **W&B Weave positioning itself at the forefront** of several key trends:

**Enhanced multi-modal support** is expanding beyond text to comprehensive tracing of images, audio, video, and other data types. This evolution reflects the growing sophistication of multi-modal AI systems that process and generate diverse content types.

**Advanced protocol integration** includes upcoming support for Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol alongside the existing Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling more sophisticated inter-agent communication patterns and standardized observability across different agent frameworks.

### Performance and scalability improvements

Future developments focus on **sub-millisecond latency impact** through edge computing integration and optimized data collection pipelines. This ensures that comprehensive observability doesn't compromise application performance, even at scale.

**Volumetric pricing models** are becoming standard, with costs based on actual data processed rather than flat fees, making enterprise-scale observability more accessible and cost-effective.

### Emerging architectural patterns

**Hybrid evaluation approaches** combine programmatic checks with LLM-based judges, providing both objective metrics and nuanced quality assessments. This dual approach ensures comprehensive evaluation coverage while maintaining efficiency.

**Real-time guardrails** with advanced content moderation and safety checks are being integrated directly into the observability layer, enabling proactive risk management rather than reactive incident response.

**AI-powered debugging** capabilities are on the horizon, with systems that can automatically detect anomalies, suggest optimizations, and even propose fixes for common issues based on patterns observed across deployments.

### Platform consolidation and enterprise features

The future points toward **unified workflows** that seamlessly integrate model training (W&B Models) with application monitoring (Weave), providing end-to-end observability from development through production.

**Enhanced enterprise capabilities** include advanced security features, comprehensive governance tools, and compliance certifications that meet the stringent requirements of regulated industries.

### Recommendations for future-proofing

To prepare for these emerging patterns, organizations should:

1. **Design flexible observability architectures** that can adapt to new protocols and standards without major refactoring
2. **Invest in team training** on advanced LLM observability practices and emerging best practices
3. **Establish governance frameworks** that can scale with increasing agent complexity and regulatory requirements
4. **Build modular systems** that can incorporate new evaluation methods and monitoring capabilities as they become available
